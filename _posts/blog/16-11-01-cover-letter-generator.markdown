## **Cover Letter Generator**


Cover Letter Generator (CLG) is single page website, built mostly using JavaScript and a Bootstrap framework.

During my a Recruiter days, I noticed that many applicants get overwhelmed at the thought of writing a cover leter. They don't know what to say, or the correct formatting to use. That is why I created the CLG, so the user can focus on writing about what makes them unique and spend less time worrying about technicalities. 

The way CLG works is very simple. The user answers a few questions, then s(he) will receive a generic and preformated cover leter. This cover letter is not intended to be a final draft, but a head start to break that writer's block.
