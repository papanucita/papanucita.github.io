excerpt: Finally up and running!

## **Celebratory 1st Post**

I have redesigned and coded this site so many times, that I can't believe it is finally up and running! 

The first version of this site was 100% written from scratch. No frameworks. No templates. Then, I learned about Bootstap, and then JavaScript. Most recently, Jekyll. Every time I learned something new, I wanted to incorporate it to the site. Not all changes have been due to technical improvements. The Design of the site has also changed frequently. I have learned about UX and Accessibility, so I have wanted to incorporated this knowledge as well. 

As a whole, I am very happy with the final product and all the knowledge that I have gained since I decided to become a Web Developer. I look forward to all the experience and knowledge that is yet to come. 

**Thank you!**
